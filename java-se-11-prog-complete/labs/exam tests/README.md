This folder contains the questions and answers to the practice questions asked in between the lessons and the final practice at the end of the course. 

I wanted to get a 100% score on all the tests and found that while remaking a test (as of one or more wrong answers) it took to much time to study the question and all of its answers again. 

Besides, when answering a question incorrectly it does not explain why it is wrong or what the correct answer should have been. 

These files also do not include explanations, or just very limited, however, knowing the correct answer it should be easier to understand the question.
