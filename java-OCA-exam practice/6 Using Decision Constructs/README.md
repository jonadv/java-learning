Excercises Chapter 6 Using Decision Constructs

1. Write a method that accepts a number as input and prints whether the number is odd or even using an if/ else statement as well as a ternary expression. 

2. Accept a number between 0 to 5 as input and print the sum of numbers from 1 to the input number using code that exploits the "fall through" behavior of a switch statement. 

3. Accept a number as input and generate output as follows using a cascaded and/ or nested if/ else statement - if the number is even print "even", if it is divisible by 3, print "three", if it is divisible by 5, print "five" and if it is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, print "unknown". If the number is divisible by 2 as well as by 3, print "23", and if the number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, print "235". 

4. Indent the following code manually such that it reflects correct if - else associations. Use a plain text editor such as Notepad. Copy the code into a Java editor such Netbeans or Eclipse and format it using the editor's auto code formatting function. Compare your formatting with the editor's.
